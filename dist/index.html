ADHD individuals are often seen as careless and unorganized as a result. However, the ability to stay focused on one task is quite the challenge. Generally, this is caused by a cognitive inability to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/adhd/are-you-simply-easily-distracted-or-do-you-have-adhd">compartmentalize and distinguish between tasks</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2626918">“brain reward cascade” dysfunction</a> causing a crave for the next big dopamine rush!</p></div></div></div><div class="section-3"><div class="container"><div class="about-content"><h2>it's a wormhole of</h2><h1>hyperactivity</h1><p>Those with ADHD may find themselves stuck feeling the need to do <a target="_blank" href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/adhd/are-you-simply-easily-distracted-or-do-you-have-adhd/">certain hyperactive behaviors</a>. This can include feeling the need to fidget, move around, talk excessively, and much more. These are behaviors ADHD individuals find very hard to control, and forceful restriction of such hyperactivity can lead to certain unhealthy impulses…</p></div></div></div><div class="section-4"><div class="container"><div class="about-content"><h2>with unpredictable</h2><h1>hyperfocus</h1><p>ADHD is less about the deficiency of attention, and more about the regulation of that attention. This is where <a target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/adhd-symptoms-hyperfocus#What-Is-Hyperfocus?">hyperfocus</a> comes in. Certain tasks can be incredibly difficult for ADHD individuals to perform, while meanwhile they may <i>absorb</i> themselves into other tasks of interest. This may be spending hours daydreaming, researching ideas, learning a new language, etc. Hyperactivity is random but exhilarating for the ADHD brain…</p></div></div></div><div class="why-section"><div class="why-container"><div class="why-content"><h1>why?</h1><p>So why is this the case? What causes ADHD in children? Well… it’s a bit of a mystery. However, psychologists believe that it may root all the way back to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/facts.html">pregnancy</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/causes/">genetics</a>. Substance abuse during pregnancy may increase the chances of the child having ADHD (such as alcohol), including environmental factors (such as lead). ADHD also tends to be genetic. If there is someone you are closely related to who has ADHD, you are more likely to also have it.</p></div></div></div><div class="treatment-section"><div class="treatment-container"><div class="treatment-content"><h1>treatment?</h1><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/treatment.html">Behavioral therapy and stimulant medication</a> are common and effective treatments used to reduce ADHD symptoms. Behavioral therapy is used to help those with ADHD to better control impulses and inappropriate behavior. In addition to therapy, stimulants such as adderall are often used as well in helping reduce behaviors. Studies have shown that 70-80% of children with ADHD who use stimulants do not show as many ADHD symptoms.</p></div></div></div><div class="conclusion-section"><div class="container"><div class="about-content"><h2>a jack of</h2><h1>all trades</h1><p>ADHD is a complicated disorder, filled with various characteristics. Those with ADHD can become easily distracted (jumping from one idea/task to the next), but - paradoxically - they can also spend hours completely absorbed into a topic, making them a great jack of trades. Luckily, ADHD is still continued to be researched into with an abundance of new studies.</p></div></div></div><canvas class="webgl"></canvas></body></html>
