# In the Realm of ADHD
is a 3D interactive website that uses Three.js technology in order to take users through an informative journey into ADHD - what it is, causes, and treatments.

This project was designed and developed by myself for a Developmental Psychology class in college.

The particle system was inspired by DesignCourse at https://www.youtube.com/user/DesignCourse?app=desktop
